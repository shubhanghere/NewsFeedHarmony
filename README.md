  ◘ NewsHarvest: RSS Feed Parsing and Database Storage◘

1)Overview-:"NewsHarvest" is a powerful Python project designed to streamline the extraction, categorization, and storage of news articles from diverse RSS feeds. The assignment aims to create an efficient and intelligent system, utilizing the capabilities of the feedparser library for parsing multiple RSS feeds.

2)Introduction-: "NewsHarvest" is a robust Python project designed to streamline the extraction, categorization, and storage of news articles from diverse RSS feeds. The primary objective of the assignment is to create an efficient and intelligent system that harnesses the capabilities of the feedparser library to parse multiple RSS feeds. The script iterates through each feed entry, extracting crucial information such as article titles, content, publication dates, and source URLs.

3)Methodology-:One of the key features of the project is its ability to handle duplicate articles. By implementing a hash-based mechanism using the SHA-256 algorithm, the script identifies and skips redundant articles within the same feed. This ensures that the database remains free of duplicate entries, contributing to data integrity.
To facilitate organized and structured storage of news data, the project introduces a MySQL database schema. The news_articles table is meticulously designed to accommodate essential information, including title, content, publication date, source URL, and category. The choice of a relational database enhances data retrieval, enabling efficient analysis of news articles.

4)Approach to the problem-:Beyond basic data extraction, the assignment incorporates sentiment analysis and keyword recognition to intelligently categorize news articles. The categorization process involves identifying keywords related to terrorism, positivity, and natural disasters, allowing for a nuanced classification of articles.

5)Conclusion-: The project's concluding section demonstrates the export of data from the MySQL database to a CSV file, addressing challenges such as the MySQL server's --secure-file-priv option. By providing a systematic approach to handling real-time news feeds, "NewsHarvest" offers a comprehensive solution for professionals seeking an efficient and adaptable tool for news data management. Its modular design, robust error handling, and emphasis on data integrity make it an impactful and versatile addition to any data-driven news analysis workflow.
